# Aboutme

Hi, I’m Varadan Venkatesan — a data-driven professional passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights that fuel smarter business decisions and measurable results.

With 6+ years of experience spanning analytics, automation, and data visualization, I have delivered impactful solutions for industry leaders including Maersk, Cognizant, and Bank of Ireland. My work has improved reporting efficiency by 35%, boosted NPS by 15%, and enabled organizations to scale data-driven decision-making.

I thrive on building intuitive dashboards, optimizing data pipelines, and designing analytical frameworks that simplify complexity. My core toolkit includes SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, NLP), Power BI (DAX), Tableau, and advanced Excel (PivotTables, Power Query, VBA). I am also skilled in cloud data environments such as Azure, AWS, and Snowflake, with experience across Hadoop, MongoDB, and ETL processes.

As a strong believer in the power of data storytelling, I combine clarity, curiosity, and collaboration to help teams unlock business value—not just surface numbers.
